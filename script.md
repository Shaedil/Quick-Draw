Zoom out from showdown
NARRATOR: Wow! This really is the duel of the century! With arduino powered nerf guns, they're able to have a fatal shootout right from their own home! Yeehaw!

Utilizing a Go powered web server, the guns communicate through pinging the server and determining who shot first!

AND COWBOY1 HAS FALLEN!

There we have it ladies and gentlemen!
As you can see we are all at the mercy of _the luck of the draw_
