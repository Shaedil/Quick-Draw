Zoom out from showdown

if you're like me and took a liken to the life of a cowboy like a horse takes a liken to oats, you need to keep up with these modern times.

It simply ain't like it was back in the good ole days, where saloons and shootouts was common.

No ma'am, now we cowfolk are confined to our homes by this fancy fangled COVID-1819

Interducin' the mighty new Quick Draw technology! Ya ever had a shootout in your living room partner?! Yeehaw!

Powered by Arduino technology and a Go webserver, I'm able to fire my gun in my underwear, ping a third party server to determine who fired first, and suffer the consequences, like any proud red-blooded american should

But don't squat on your spurs partner! Any good cowboy knows not to ask a barber if ya need a haircut, so take a look at our 100% gen-you-ine reviews 

_theyre all 5 stars ;)_

BANG
AND COWBOY1 HAS FALLEN!

Now that's _the luck of the draw_
